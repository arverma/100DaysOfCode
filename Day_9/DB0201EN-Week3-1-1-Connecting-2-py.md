<h1 align=center><font size = 5>Lab: Connect to Db2 database on Cloud using Python</font></h1>

# Introduction

This notebook illustrates how to access DB2 Warehouse on Cloud using Python by following the steps below:
1. Import the `ibm_db` Python library
1. Enter the database connection credentials
1. Create the database connection
1. Close the database connection



__Notice:__ Please follow the instructions given in the first Lab of this course to Create a database service instance of Db2 on Cloud and retrieve your database credentials.

## Import the `ibm_db` Python library

The `ibm_db` [API ](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibm_db/) provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBMÂ® data server database, including functions for connecting to a database, preparing and issuing SQL statements, fetching rows from result sets, calling stored procedures, committing and rolling back transactions, handling errors, and retrieving metadata.


We first import the ibm_db library into our Python Application

Execute the following cell by clicking within it and then 
press shift and enter keys simultaneously



```python
import ibm_db
```

When the command above completes, the `ibm_db` library is loaded in your notebook. 


## Identify the database connection credentials

Connecting to dashDB or DB2 database requires the following information:
* Driver Name
* Database name 
* Host DNS name or IP address 
* Host port
* Connection protocol
* User ID (or username)
* User Password



__Notice:__ To obtain credentials please refer to the instructions given in the first Lab of this course

Now enter your database credentials below

Replace the placeholder values in angular brackets <> below with your actual database credentials 

e.g. replace "< database >" with "BLUDB"



```python
dsn_driver = "{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}"
dsn_database = "BLUDB"            # e.g. "BLUDB"
dsn_hostname = "dashdb-entry-yp-dal10-01.services.dal.bluemix.net" # e.g.: "awh-yp-small03.services.dal.bluemix.net"
dsn_port = "50000"                # e.g. "50000" 
dsn_protocol = "TCPIP"            # i.e. "TCPIP"
dsn_uid = "dash6345"        # e.g. "dash104434"
dsn_pwd = "_Oc3Qpk8ZhJ_"       # e.g. "7dBZ3wWt9XN6$o0JiX!m"
```

## Create the DB2 database connection

Ibm_db API uses the IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI APIs to connect to IBM DB2 and Informix.


Lets build the dsn connection string using the credentials you entered above



```python
#Create the dsn connection string
dsn = (
    "DRIVER={0};"
    "DATABASE={1};"
    "HOSTNAME={2};"
    "PORT={3};"
    "PROTOCOL={4};"
    "UID={5};"
    "PWD={6};").format(dsn_driver, dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_protocol, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)

#print the connection string to check correct values are specified
print(dsn)
```

    DRIVER={IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER};DATABASE=BLUDB;HOSTNAME=dashdb-entry-yp-dal10-01.services.dal.bluemix.net;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=dash6345;PWD=_Oc3Qpk8ZhJ_;


Now establish the connection to the database


```python
#Create database connection

try:
    conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, "", "")
    print ("Connected!")

except:
    print ("Unable to connect to database")


```

    Connected!


## Close the Connection
We free all resources by closing the connection. Remember that it is always important to close connections so that we can avoid unused connections taking up resources.



```python
ibm_db.close(conn)
```




    True



## Summary

In this tutorial you established a connection to a DB2 Warehouse on Cloud database from a Python notebook using ibm_db API.
